Multi Armed bandits is a problem in which a fixed limited set of resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation, and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice In stochastic multi armed bandit problems the rewards for playing each arm are generated independently from unknown distributions corresponding to each arm. In adversarial multi armed bandit problems a sequence of rewards is generated for each arm by an adversary before the game starts."
